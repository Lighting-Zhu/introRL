![teaser](asset/teaser.png)
## Overview
This short course will introduce basic concepts of reinforcement learning in a nutshell. Slides will be made in English and lectures will be given by [Bolei](http://bzhou.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) in Chinese. The course is for entertainment only.  

## Course Schedule
The short course will be arranged as follows. Lectures 1-8 will be the foundation, the others will be the advanced topics, which are optional.
